Question: Do They Like Me?
==========================

This sentiment analysis model is the latest inovation in AI technology
that aims to solve one of humanity's greatest questions: do they like me?

Save yourself the excruciating and painful experience of having to ask
your crush "do you like me?" by instead spending hours training an AI
model to attempt to decode their hidden affection within your texts!

(Originally called "Question: Does she like me?" (QDSLM), but I realized
after making the project that the title should be gender neutral)

Wait, so what is this?
----------------------

This is a small project I'm undertaking to learn more about machine
learning. Though the intent of utilizing this sentiment analysis model
to analyze your crush's texts is purely for comedy, it is nevertheless
the objective of this project.

**This is a work-in-progress project!** Do not expect this to be
deployed within the near future (or at all usable). My code will be
messy!
