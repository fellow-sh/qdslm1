# Question: Do they Like Me?

This sentiment analysis model is the latest inovation in AI technology that aims to solve one of humanity's greatest questions: do they like me?

Save yourself the excruciating and painful experience of having to ask your crush "do you like me?" by instead spending hours training an AI model to attempt to decode their hidden affection within your texts!

(Originally called "Question: Does she like me?" (QDSLM), but I realized after making the project that the title should be gender neutral)
